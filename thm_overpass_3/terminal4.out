[m
[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
     [1mssh[0m (SSH client) is a program for logging into a remote machine and for executing commands on a remote machine.  It is intended to provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted[m
     hosts over an insecure network.  X11 connections, arbitrary TCP ports and UNIX-domain sockets can also be forwarded over the secure channel.[m
[m
     [1mssh[0m connects and logs into the specified [4mdestination[24m, which may be specified as either [user@]hostname or a URI of the form ssh://[user@]hostname[:port].  The user must prove his/her identity[m
     to the remote machine using one of several methods (see below).[m
[m
     If a [4mcommand[24m is specified, it is executed on the remote host instead of a login shell.[m
[m
     The options are as follows:[m
[m
     [1m-4[0m      Forces [1mssh[0m to use IPv4 addresses only.[m
[m
     [1m-6[0m      Forces [1mssh[0m to use IPv6 addresses only.[m
[m
     [1m-A[0m      Enables forwarding of connections from an authentication agent such as ssh-agent(1).  This can also be specified on a per-host basis in a configuration file.[m
[m
             Agent forwarding should be enabled with caution.  Users with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the agent's UNIX-domain socket) can access the local agent[m
             through the forwarded connection.  An attacker cannot obtain key material from the agent, however they can perform operations on the keys that enable them to authenticate using the[m
             identities loaded into the agent.  A safer alternative may be to use a jump host (see [1m-J[0m).[m
[m
     [1m-a[0m      Disables forwarding of the authentication agent connection.[m
[m
     [1m-B[0m [4mbind_interface[24m[m
             Bind to the address of [4mbind_interface[24m before attempting to connect to the destination host.  This is only useful on systems with more than one address.[m
[m
     [1m-b[0m [4mbind_address[24m[m
             Use [4mbind_address[24m on the local machine as the source address of the connection.  Only useful on systems with more than one address.[m
[m
     [1m-C[0m      Requests compression of all data (including stdin, stdout, stderr, and data for forwarded X11, TCP and UNIX-domain connections).  The compression algorithm is the same used by gzip(1).[m
             Compression is desirable on modem lines and other slow connections, but will only slow down things on fast networks.  The default value can be set on a host-by-host basis in the con‐[m
             figuration files; see the [1mCompression[0m option.[m
[m
     [1m-c[0m [4mcipher_spec[24m[m
             Selects the cipher specification for encrypting the session.  [4mcipher_spec[24m is a comma-separated list of ciphers listed in order of preference.  See the [1mCiphers[0m keyword in ssh_config(5)[m
             for more information.[m
[m
     [1m-D[0m [[4mbind_address[24m:][4mport[24m[m
             Specifies a local “dynamic” application-level port forwarding.  This works by allocating a socket to listen to [4mport[24m on the local side, optionally bound to the specified [4mbind_address[24m.[m
             Whenever a connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and the application protocol is then used to determine where to connect to from the re‐[m
             mote machine.  Currently the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and [1mssh[0m will act as a SOCKS server.  Only root can forward privileged ports.  Dynamic port forwardings can also[m
             be specified in the configuration file.[m

Usage:
 mount [-lhV]
 mount -a [options]
 mount [options] [--source] <source> | [--target] <directory>
 mount [options] <source> <directory>
 mount <operation> <mountpoint> [<target>]

Mount a filesystem.

Options:
 -a, --all               mount all filesystems mentioned in fstab
 -c, --no-canonicalize   don't canonicalize paths
 -f, --fake              dry run; skip the mount(2) syscall
 -F, --fork              fork off for each device (use with -a)
 -T, --fstab <path>      alternative file to /etc/fstab
 -i, --internal-only     don't call the mount.<type> helpers
 -l, --show-labels       show also filesystem labels
 -n, --no-mtab           don't write to /etc/mtab
     --options-mode <mode>
                         what to do with options loaded from fstab
     --options-source <source>
                         mount options source
     --options-source-force
                         force use of options from fstab/mtab
 -o, --options <list>    comma-separated list of mount options
 -O, --test-opts <list>  limit the set of filesystems (use with -a)
 -r, --read-only         mount the filesystem read-only (same as -o ro)
 -t, --types <list>      limit the set of filesystem types
     --source <src>      explicitly specifies source (path, label, uuid)
     --target <target>   explicitly specifies mountpoint
 -v, --verbose           say what is being done
 -w, --rw, --read-write  mount the filesystem read-write (default)
 -N, --namespace <ns>    perform mount in another namespace

 -h, --help              display this help
 -V, --version           display version

Source:
 -L, --label <label>     synonym for LABEL=<label>
 -U, --uuid <uuid>       synonym for UUID=<uuid>
 LABEL=<label>           specifies device by filesystem label
 UUID=<uuid>             specifies device by filesystem UUID
 PARTLABEL=<label>       specifies device by partition label
 PARTUUID=<uuid>         specifies device by partition UUID
 <device>                specifies device by path
 <directory>             mountpoint for bind mounts (see --bind/rbind)
 <file>                  regular file for loopdev setup

Operations:
 -B, --bind              mount a subtree somewhere else (same as -o bind)
 -M, --move              move a subtree to some other place
 -R, --rbind             mount a subtree and all submounts somewhere else
 --make-shared           mark a subtree as shared
 --make-slave            mark a subtree as slave
 --make-private          mark a subtree as private
